# jobtastic- Celery tasks plus more awesome

Celery is the awesome python job queueing tool
and jobtastic is a python library (plus javascript)

or if your users need to wait while they compute their results.

* Easy progress estimation/reporting
* Job status feedback
* A jQuery plugin for easy client-side progress display
* Result caching
* [Thundering herd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem) avoidance

after they're triggered, you should try Jobtastic.

You could write all of the stuff yourself, but why?
